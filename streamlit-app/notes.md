The Real-Time Playback Mode is essentially a way to simulate how your fall-detection model would perform on a continuous stream of sensor data, rather than on a single, pre-cut window. Here’s what it does step by step:

Full-Trace Upload
You provide one long CSV of raw accelerometer & gyroscope readings (plus any extra columns) for a single trial or recording. This might be hundreds or thousands of rows.

On-the-Fly Preprocessing
As soon as you upload, the app applies the same low-pass filtering and scaling you used during training—just as if the watch were streaming data in real time.

Sliding Window Selection
A slider control (“Select Window Start”) lets you choose the starting sample index for a fixed-length window (in our case, 500 samples).

Moving the slider mimics shifting your analysis window forward in time.

You can “scrub” through the recording to see how the model would classify each segment.

Dynamic Inference
For whichever 500-sample slice you’ve selected, the app runs your CNN and returns:

Predicted label (FALL or ADL)

Confidence score (softmax probability)

Visual Feedback
The app then plots the accelerometer magnitude (√(x² + y² + z²)) over that window, with the title showing your prediction and confidence. This gives you an immediate sense of how spikes or patterns in the signal correspond to “fall” vs. “no fall.”

Why this matters for stakeholders:

Transparency: They can see exactly where in a continuous recording the model thinks a fall happened.

Interactivity: By sliding through the data, they get a feel for how robust the detection is—whether it flags only true falls or also spurious bumps.

Demonstration of Real-World Use: It mirrors the way a deployed system would continuously monitor an elder’s movements and trigger an alert immediately when a fall-like pattern emerges.
